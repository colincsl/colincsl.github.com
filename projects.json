            "description": "Abstract: We present an entry into the Solutions in Perceptions Challenge as part of the 2011 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). The goal of this competition is to determine the pose and classification of household objects within a series of increasingly complex scenes using an XBox Kinect. Contributions are made in the training and detection phases of our system. Through evaluation we ultimately found the best results using a table-removal-based object detection system, texture-based classification using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and pose estimation using Multi-Resolution Occupied Lists (MROL). Preliminary results show high classification accuracy and adequate pose estimation on the training datasets."

            "description": "Abstract: The K-Nearest Neighbors classifier is evaluated on data sets which are sampled from separate Gaussian distributions. Experiments are conducted to determine the accuracy of classification on samples (1) using various numbers of neighbors (k=1...9), (2) from distributions with varying means, and (3) that are injected with false initial class labels. Accuracy is found to rise moderately with an increase in the number of neighbors in most cases. When distributions are close in proximity the effect of injecting a large number of \"false\" labelled data points has a relatively small effect."

However, current methods can be too slow or not sufﬁcient for distinguishing multiple classes. Techniques that rely on binary (foreground/background) labels incorrectly identify areas with multiple overlapping objects as single segment. We propose two Hierarchical Markov Random Field models in efforts to distinguish connected objects using tiered, binary label sets. Near-realtime performance has been achieved using efﬁcient optimization methods which runs up to 11 frames per second on a dual core 2.2 Ghz processor. Evaluation of both models is done using footage taken from a robot obstacle course at the 2010 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition."
