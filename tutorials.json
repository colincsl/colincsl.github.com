An introduction to implementing virtual fixtures with X3D and more in depth applications using Python are provided. The creation of new force effects using C++ for enhanced manipulation is also presented. The target demographic is anyone interested in haptics with some programming experience."

It is possible to create a collection of rigid bodies and joints with actuators and sensors without having to develop the kinematic equations. In this tutorial I demonstrate how to develop a fourbar mechanism."
