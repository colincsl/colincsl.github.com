	I am a 5th year PhD student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University who works on fine-grained action recognition in complex domains. Some application areas include surgical workflow analysis, activity recognition in intensive care units, cooking tasks, and collaborative manufacturing. At Hopkins, I am part of the <a href="http://lcsr.jhu.edu">Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics</a> co-advised by <a href="http://cirl.lcsr.jhu.edu/">Greg Hager</a> and <a href="http://cis.jhu.edu/~rvidal/">Rene Vidal</a>. I spend much of my time thinking about time series models (e.g. CRFs, Temporal CNNs, Segmental Models) for video and multi-modal sensor data. I am a <a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a> and an <a href="http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/">Intuitive Surgical</a> Fellow.
